Apply to write for Her Campus!You can expect to hear your friends frequently asking you, “Did you see that post on Inpower?” now that founder Razan Talevian has brought her inspirational attitude to women across the country and beyond. The highly successful Facebook group was created early this year by the 20-year-old from North Vancouver, and currently boasts over 14,000 members. The aim of this space is for all women, regardless of differences, to “ask, show and inspire” each other, as per the groups description. Here, women ask each other for advice or support, share tips and tricks, and engage in healthy debate over popular topics. I had the opportunity to ask Razan some questions about her inspiration for the organization and her goals for the future.How would you describe yourself?Well, first of all, you should know that I’m a huge believer of mindset and energy, and spreading positivity through actions and vibes! I aspire to connect people to one another. These experiences we connect in make us who we are, as we are whom we associate ourselves with. If we practice being mindful of one another and relating through positivity not judgment, I believe we can revolutionize the way people connect.Wow, incredible! So what motivated you to create the group?I always put others before myself, and find happiness by giving others happiness. I asked myself, “How do I spread my unconditional love, support, and care to everyone? I am just one person, and there are so many people to reach out to who need someone for support.” And then I realized I wasn’t the only one who felt this way.You must be thankful a free platform like Facebook is available to do this!I instantly thought of Facebook being the best outlet to start this because people are constantly on it, and it is basically free marketing. I am very grateful that there is a free platform like this available! Were there any concerns you had with creating this large group of women?I am aware of a lot of cyber bullying that goes on, especially in this day and, so this was truly the biggest test. If I can manage a non-judgmental group with open-minded individuals who maintain a foundation of respect, then I know I have succeeded.So you have to tell us…why “Inpower”?I knew if I wanted to register a society one day, then using the word ‘empower’ would not be an option because it is a known word in English and would be declined by Trademark Canada. When people verbally release words, it releases emotions as you speak, so I wanted people to say the word POWER as they referred to the group, so they could feel it. It’s also a play on words, as we are all “IN” power. We are the power, and we have the power to use this power how we want.Tell me about your future plans for the organization.I have such optimistic dreams that I want to achieve, but it will take time and a lot of patience! I want to partner with as many other organizations as I can, so we can benefit each other and help each other grow. We also want to do a lot of charity work, workshops, events, or anything that is decided by the members of the society. If they want something done, we will make it happen. I am hoping for Inpower to be the biggest benchmark to support women in any way they need it.So you are planning of expanding beyond Facebook?I would like to continue the Facebook group, but also create an app in the future which also will have all of these partnerships included to help women adventure through their lives. Is there anything else you’d like to mention?I would like to give a shout out to all the members of Inpower! This would have not been possible without all of your energy and positivity. Together we have changed lives and you all have truly changed mine!I myself was so inspired by Razan that I decided to create my own “subsociety” of Inpower called “Horsepower," which is a space on Facebook for horse-loving Inpower women to discuss their equestrian companions. Other subsocieties include a space for writers and a space for LGBTQ+ individuals, all based on Razan’s original concept. Anonymous questions can be emailed to inpower@hotmail.com, or you can be added to the group by contacting Rozan Talevian on Facebook.Do you have a way with words? Apply to write for Her Campus!

My coach back home came to Strathclyde as a student and fenced and coached at Strathclyde, that would have been at least 20 odd years ago, and I know one of our current coaches has been with us for over 20 years.How long have you been a part of Fencing? I have been fencing since my 2nd year at secondary school, about 7 years now, 5 of which have been competitively.Do you compete in competitions with other Universities?  Do you have a way with words? Apply to write for Her Campus!Need a break from studying? Try visiting one of the only on-campus, student-exclusive nail businesses called NAILEDit! This little nail place has great quality at inexpensive prices. The cost of a plain colour is $4.99, and, for a nice intricate design, the price is a low $9.99. Situated in 90 University, the walk isn't far, and is quite convenient as the weather grows colder. Although, if you want to beat the cold entirely, for an extra $2.00, NAILEDit! will come to you as long as you are located somewhere on campus. NAILEDit! does its best to make their customers happy and has rapidly developed ‘chipped’ and ‘redo’ policies. The chipped policy allows a customer to come back when the polish begins to peel and have it touched up for half price. In the second policy, if you don’t like the design, NAILEDit! will take it off and give you another one at your request right then and there (although this policy has not yet been needed).   Choosing a design shouldn’t be difficult either as NAILEDit! has a wide variety to choose from. Anywhere from studs to glitter to beads or matte and glossy textures, this student-only nail business has everything you could possibly desire. When scheduling an appointment, it is recommended to book at least forty-eight hours in advance. This is especially important on weekends, as appointments tend to fill up very quickly. When requesting a plain colour, a typical appointment takes about ten to fifteen minutes per person. With more intricate designs, it takes about half an hour for one individual.To see what kinds of designs NAILEDit! can create, take a look at their Instagram account: @nailediitt. Even If you’ve looked through all the photos and don’t see what you’re looking for, send NAILEDit! an image of what you’d like (ex: from Google or Pinterest), and they'll let you know if they can do it for you. To book an appointment or to ask any questions, you can send them an email at naileditt@hotmail.comSo, instead of stressing over finals, take a relaxing break and get your nails done with some friends!With years of experience and a passion for manicures, NAILEDit! is guaranteed to give you nails that you fall in love with!Photo Credits: 1 2 3 4*Images have been taken from the internet but the designs represented may be similarly duplicated by the nail artists at this establishment* Do you have a way with words? Apply to write for Her Campus!Carly SnowdonYear: Class of 2016Major: SMAD – Converged MediaMinor: British Communication & MediaWhat attracted you to drawing and art in general?I’ve just loved art my whole life. My mom was an art teacher so I did a lot of art growing up. For a long time, I thought I couldn’t draw so I mostly did other forms of art. I took art throughout high school, but I didn’t really like it because they kind of have an expectation for everything to be a certain style and it was uninspiring to me. I didn’t start drawing until maybe freshman year of college when I found my own style artistically, and now all I do is draw.What's your favorite part of what you do?Drawing is just how I love to spend my time. I’ll just go into a coffee shop or sit somewhere on campus and listen to some good music and draw for hours. Do a little people-watching, drink a little tea. It’s just my favorite thing. Also just recently I’ve starting designing tattoos that friends of mine actually go and get done, so that’s really cool too.Where do you see your designs in the next 5 years?I’ve been drawing for a while, but just within the past year I’ve started selling drawings and doing customized freelance work, so hopefully that will continue to happen! I really enjoy working freelance. I definitely intend to make a website or start an Etsy shop eventually so I can sell more designs. I don’t get to draw quite as much as I’d like to because I’m really busy with school and everything, so hopefully when I graduate I can start working on some bigger projects and produce more work. How can people see your work?The best way to see my work right now is on Instagram: @carlunadesigns. That’s where I keep the biggest collection of my work so far, but I am working on creating a portfolio website at the moment.How can people contact you?I can be contacted by email at carly.liz@hotmail.com. Or you can contact me on Instagram @Carlunadesigns!Have you ever thought "Am I the only one who..."? I'm sure you have, and I promise you're not. Live the life you love. I don't take things too seriously, because life is too short to be so obsessed with what everyone thinks of me. I became a writer so I could say what everyone else is thinking. I believe that treating others the way you want to be treated means you will never have to regret a decision you make. I make mistakes, but that's what makes great articles!Do you have a way with words?

The aim of the charity (to get all young people regularly checking their boobs and familiar with the early signs/symptoms of breast cancer) is so relevant to university students and I have loved the opportunity to set up a Uni Boob Team here at Exeter! What do you think is the best thing about CoppaFeel!?The best thing about CoppaFeel! is the weird looks you get when you are wearing a giant boob! We raise awareness and try to get as many young people starting the healthy habit of regular boob checking through fun events and platforms such as the #whatnormalfeelslike campaign. CoppaFeel! gives us the opportunity on campus to break the negative taboos around boob checking. They also offer a monthly text reminder service, so text ‘ubtexeter’ to 70500 for your free monthly boob checking reminders (and a 20% off Boux Avenue discount!). What are Exeter UBT’s plans for this term?This term we have planned our first Boob Ball tournament for the 27th February 3.30-5.00pm (dodge ball with balls in the shape of boobs!), and we will also be hosting another event before Cheesy Tuesdays near the end of the term. We are also hoping to collaborate further with BodySoc on their Film and Pizza Night! To keep updated with our events like us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter! www.facebook.com/ubtexeter @UBTExeter What would you say to anyone that is considering getting involved?Being part of the Uni Boob Team is a fun and rewarding way to get involved with charity work in your time at university. There are so many opportunities within the team so you can get involved in fundraising, awareness or publicising the charity. Email ubtexeter@hotmail.co.uk or search for us on Facebook or Twitter to find out more. What are your hobbies outside of UBT?I am running the Bath Half for CoppaFeel! in less than a month so I am trying to get some serious training time in at the moment! There is nothing better than running at the Quay early in the morning with the sun shining! To find out more about CoppaFeel! visit their website at www.coppafeel.org and remember: knowing your boobs could save your lifePhoto credit: FacebookDo you have a way with words?
