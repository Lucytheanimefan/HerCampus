Before you read about Daniel Jackson’s position as a Google Student Ambassador (GSA), let me tell you a little bit more about this incredible guy! Daniel is a guy with a lot of ambition and motivation. He strives to be the best that he can be to further himself, but he also focuses on what is best for others. Not only is he a GSA, but he is also a member of the Interdenominational Youth Choir, a Golden Apple Scholar and the newly elected Vice President for ISU’s branch, a member of Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity Inc., and a Human Resource Tour guide. Did I mention that he is also a Resident’s Assistant for the campus? This guy is crazy involved!Name: Daniel JacksonHometown: Chicago        Major: Elementary EducationRole Model: President Barack Obama Her Campus Illinois State: Describe yourself in three words.Daniel Jackson: Perseverance, Empathic, and High-spirited. HC ISU: Describe Google in three words.DJ: Accessible, Humble, and Relaxed. HC ISU: What is your role as a Google Student Ambassador?DJ: As a GSA, I am hired for a one-year commitment to hosting programs throughout the community of ISU. My specialty work is using Google Drive. Different organizations allow me to come to their meetings, (especially RSOs), to teach their organization more techniques to become tech savvy within their weekly meetings. To highlight one of my events this semester, Google Hang Outreach, which is a college based initiative for Googlers to speak to college students in the computer science world but also give resume tips, scholarship information, discussion of how to get hired for Google, and how to prepare for a career through their 4-year plan. HC ISU: How did you get this role?DJ: I received an opportunity with Google when I was invited to the Google office in Chicago by the Chicago Scholars Foundation as a high-schooler. They asked me if I would like to become an Ambassador for Google and I simply said yes. The Googlers kept in contact with me for two years and recommended me for the position to become a GSA on my campus. I then filled out the application and found out I got the position late summer 2015. I felt ecstatic to have an opportunity with Google. After I confirmed the position with Google, I was flown out to California to get tours of the Google offices on the west coast and learn about Google through orientation, where I learned about the programs and products of Google.  HC ISU: What do you enjoy most about being a Google Student Ambassador?DJ: I love being able to “evangelize” Google programs. Often Google uses the word evangelize because they want to make the technology world simple and accessible for all people including institutions, organizations, and corporations. Ever since I was 11, I fell in love with using Google programs such as Google drive. It made my life in middle school much simpler. One aspect that I admire about Google is that they continue to grow as a company and are updating programs and products daily to ensure that their services are being accessible for everyone worldwide. HC ISU: How are you able to manage being a Google Student Ambassador on top of class, being an R.A., and having a social life?DJ: While being a Resident Assistant, I have held a program and a Google “swag” giveaway. Earlier in the semester I asked my residents and my fellow baseball athletes to do a Google brain teaser to win some “swag.” Directions were to complete individually within five minutes and the brain teaser had to look exactly like the example that was shown. They were able to complete the task successfully and in a time consuming manner. I also invited former residents to my Google Hang Outreach program which allowed them to learn resume tips and opportunities within the Google world.  HC ISU: How does being involved with Google (or any other organizations) help you in school or for your future?DJ: All of my experience as a GSA will help me for a future educator. There are plenty of opportunities I have had to plan, work with a team, learn different dialects, send emails or notifications, and teach. All of these aspects will allow me to be a phenomenal teacher who will be able to give back to the community with what I have received through my life time. HC ISU: What would be your advice to those looking to get more involved or to those who are unsure of getting more involved due to not wanting to be overwhelmed?DJ: The advice I would give to students who are trying to get involved is find one or two hobbies that you care most about and then join a student organization or seek to find a community service throughout the Bloomington-Normal area. I am a person who loves to help people and see close bonds within people and organizations. I urge people to get involved to meet new people, build connections, and possibly establish career opportunities.   Congratulations on everything that you do and the amazing future that you have ahead of you, Daniel. You’ll make many proud!  I like to spend my free time being half black, eating watermelon, playing basketball, and cuddling with my cat. Do you have a way with words?

But, it's one of google's coolest features (at least in my opinion) and it's getting in the Halloweekend spirit. If you didn't google it yet, Google Trends gives you the what, when, and where of popular searches at zero charge. Wondering who else is searching for Taylor Swift's Teletubby halloween costume? Google Trends will let you know that it's currently the 75th top search... so, you may or may not be the only psycho tswift stalker.So, Google Trends might not seem as useful to your daily life as Gmail, Google Maps, or the actual Google search engine (unless maybe you're an HC writer trying to improve your SEO), BUT it is this weekend!! In the holiday spirit, Google Trends launched "Frightgeist." This feature lets you know what the most popular costumes are across the US (or should I say Gotham City). According to Frightgeist, the top costume right now is Harley Quinn.Wondering what other collegiettes in our area are wearing this weekend? Here are the top 3 in Massachussets right now:1. Pirate2. Superhero3. Batman (actually #3 was Harley Quinn, but I'm gonna pretend we're a little bit different?)I highly reccommend Frightgeist for some last second costume inspiration (or some verification that no one else thought of your super clever costume you've been perfecting since this summer.) Halloweekend isn't only about the costume. Find out what else you need to know to Survive Tufts Halloweekend. Sources:https://frightgeist.withgoogle.comhttp://www.fenzyme.comhttps://sarahforshaw.wordpress.comhttp://www.creatingreallyawesomefreethings.comhttp://hative.com Do you have a way with words?

It's crunch time and there really aren't enough hours in the day to get it all done.Google Docs/Google Drive can be your best friend during this time, or any time, of the semester. Here are some ways you can make use of all of it's wonderful capabilities and hopefully it will help you out with any of your final assignments!1) Google Drive/Google Docs is free!!!You are given 15GB of free storage to share across Google Drive, Gmail, and Google Photo.2) Google Drive allows you to make more than just text documents.You can create slideshows, spreadsheets, forms, drawings, maps, and share photos.3) Google Drive saves room on your computer.If you're anything like me, your computer is probably filled to capacity with various files -- everything from Microsoft Word documents and PowerPoint slides to videos and mp3 files from iTunes. Saving files to Google Drive will give your computer a little break. (Totally reccommend purchasing an external hard drive at some point, though!)4) You can collaborate with others.Group projects are literally the WORST. Google Drive allows you to collaborate on documents (docs, spreadsheets, slideshows, etc.) so you can all work on a document together on your own time from your own computer. You can also hold virtual meetings if needed (there is a text chat capability, so you can ask questions or leave comments.) You will all be able to see what has been done on the document so you can watch your project come together and know how your progess is.5) You can view and create documents from an Android, iPhone, or iPad.The app is called "Docs" on mobile smart phone devices.6) Everything autosaves. Google files will automatically save as you type, so if you accidentally X out of the page or your internet crashes suddenly, your document will be able to be revived and you will have lost nothing! Hallelujah!7) As long as you have internet connection, you can access your documents anywhere.If you don't have your laptop with you, you can make use of the computers at school to access and work on any documents you have saved on your Google Drive.8) Files are converted easily.Documents can be converted to Microsoft Word (.docx), OpenDocument Format (.odt), Rich Text Format (.rtf), PDF Document (.pdf), Plain Text (.txt), Webpage (.html, zipped)Jessica Norton, 22, Communication Arts major / Journalism minor at Marymount Manhattan College in New York City.

Apply to write for Her Campus!Disclaimer: This post is not affiliated with nor sponsored by Google.It’s time to leave the bliss of peppermint patties and cinnamon scented candles, and return to reality. The reality is, Winter quarter has started, and let’s face it. Who really likes Winter quarter? The cold weather practically begs us to stay under our covers and ditch class for yet another Gossip Girl marathon. How’s a girl to stay on-task in the most sluggish season of the year?Plan ahead! While it may not be for everyone, busy collegiates without an eidetic memory could benefit from whipping out a paper and pen or, in the twenty-first century, a laptop.While good ol’ fashioned paper planners will always have a special place in my heart, there are a slew of functions in electronic planners that make life especially easy. Personally, I love using Google Calendar to plan out my week and coordinate meetings. As long as you have a Gmail account, you can also use Google Calendar to organize your life. Here are some ways to optimize your use of Google Calendar.1. Repeat EventsThis is a simple, time-saving feature that you definitely can’t find in a paper planner. Once you’ve created your event, click on it, then follow the blue text that says “Edit Event.” Click on the checkbox that reads “Repeat.” Now, you can customize the repetition of your event. For example, if you have a Tuesday and Thursday class, check repeat on Tuesday and Thursday, then end the class after 20 times (2 classes per week x 10 weeks = 20 classes).2. Share EventsSharing events allows you to send invites to your coworkers’, classmates’, or friends’ Google Calendars. It informs them via email, and once they’ve accepted the invitation, it will automatically appear on their calendars. It will also email you about whether your coworkers have accepted or declined. You can share events by clicking “Edit Event” and then typing your guests’ emails into the “Add” bar to the right.3. Share CalendarsSharing Calendars is by far my favorite feature in Google Calendar. Instead of going through the trouble of talking back and forth to plan a meeting, you can share your calendar and compare free blocks with your coworkers. This makes the complicated task of coordinating meetings for several people much simpler. It also allows those with access to your calendar to coordinate meetings for you if you’re ever too busy to do so yourself. I even use this feature to help me determine when to go grocery shopping with my roommates or have dinner with my friends. To share a calendar, click the arrow to the right of the particular calendar you wish to share. Then, click “Share this Calendar.” This should take you to a page in which you can enter the email addresses of the people whom with you want to share your calendar. Google Calendar also gives you control over the level of access that each person has to your calendar. You have options like “Make changes AND manage sharing,” “Make changes to events,” “See all event details,” and “See only free/busy (hide details).”4. Create Multiple CalendarsAside from your main calendar, Google Calendar gives you the ability to compartmentalize your life by creating other calendars as well. While this may initially seem redundant, it is in fact a very useful feature. Let’s say you’re in an organization that operates on a strict schedule, with meetings, deadlines, and events galore. Creating a Google Calendar that multiple members can edit is the perfect way to keep events in sync and all in one place. Furthermore, if your main calendar is shared with a good number of your coworkers, but you like to plan out your leisure time as well, then you can make a separate calendar for the latter. The ability to create multiple calendars allows you to create separate calendars for tasks like tracking your period or keeping tabs on office hours, which may not be so relevant to your every day life and main calendar.5. Hide CalendarsLastly, once you’ve created an avalanche of calendars and received multiple calendars from other people, you’re probably not going to want to view them all. By clicking the square to the left of each calendar on the sidebar, you can either display or hide any calendar of your choosing.By clicking one of the boxes below, you can single out any one of your calendars for a better view.Still not convinced that you want to give Google Calendar a spin? Check out a testimonial from Mariah Watson, who divides her time between studying as a full time student and working over 40 hours a week for student government. “Google Calendar helps me make sense of my life. It organizes all of the things I’m passionate about in one place, so I don’t lose track of what’s important to me," Mariah Kala Watson, ASUCD President, said.All in all, Google Calendar’s many functional utilities make it one of the best electronic planners around. I am honestly convinced that I owe a significant portion of my organization to Google Calendar. Without it, I would be a frantic, jumbled mess. So what are you waiting for?

In the distant future, she hopes to become an entertainment lawyer so she can wear Western business attire every day, combining her passion for fashion, public relations, and law.Do you have a way with words?

You want to figure out your budget early on, and know what you can spend less money on and what you can’t. Here’s some ways to help you save money in the process.1. Google is your new BFFGoogle the places you want to visit. There are many guides online for free/cheap eats, sees, and sleeps. Plus, a lot of cities offer student discounts or packages on tourist sites. Ask Google all your questions BEFORE you leave the beautiful lands of Canada.2. Figure out the cheapest way to book your flightUse sites like Skyscanner or Farecompare to check out when the flight to your destination is cheapest. Start checking right about… now. Usually, it’ll be least expensive to leave on a Tuesday or Wednesday. And don’t forget to check for extra or hidden fees.3. Don’t assume you’ll need a rail passUnless you’re taking long-distance trains all the time while you’re over yonder, it’ll probably be cheaper to pre-book single rail tickets. It’s also worth it to look at the price of bus tickets. Know your options and choose accordingly.4. Unlock your phone and buy a prepaid SIM card when you arriveInternational roaming rates are brutal. If you got your phone from Rogers, Telus, Bell, or any of their subsidiaries, it’s going to be locked to that company; however, they all can unlock it now for around $50. It’s cheapest to buy a local SIM card, but in countries like Germany, you need to be a German citizen to buy one (which is a hassle). The other option is to buy prepaid international SIMs like iRoam or WorldSIM. Which are still cheaper than the rates of the Big 3.5. Find free wifi whenever you can!See that Starbucks? Go in, get a frapp, and use the wifi while you’re at it. Snap your friend, Facebook your mom, figure out which bus to take back to the hostel. Which reminds me, life will be a lot easier if you book hotels/hostels/etc. that offer free wifi.And at the end of the day, make sure to have fun and enjoy the experience!Don’t worry over money while you’re there, and make sure to send us lots of pictures.What are your favourite travel tips?  Picture CreditsCover Picture, 1Scarf collector and exotic foods connoisseur.  Do you have a way with words?
