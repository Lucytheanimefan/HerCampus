Interning can be overwhelming. Interning in a huge city can be downright terrifying. Last week, I had the chance to intern for a fashion designer in New York City; here’s what I learned. 1. MAKE SURE YOUR PHONE IS ALWAYS CHARGEDI can’t stress this enough. Most interns are sent on errands around the city. Using map quest and HopStop can drain your battery fast. Bring your charger with you! Better yet, buy a case that can charge your phone multiple times. If you find yourself in a pinch, dim the brightness on your phone to extend the life of your battery.2. Have a PlanIf you’re in New York City, make sure you have the app HopStop. HopStop will give you multiple routes (both by train and foot) to get to your final destination. If you plan on walking, MapQuest is more detailed, but be warned that it drains your battery rapidly! The subway can be confusing at first, but the more you use it, the easier it gets!3. Sometimes There’s Nothing to DoAs an intern you should always try to find something that needs to be done, but sometimes there’s really nothing to do. Check with your supervisor periodically to see if there is anything else that needs to be done. If not, take some time to relax and CHARGE YOUR PHONE.4. NetworkMake an effort to connect with other interns. All the new interns I met were super nice and always willing to help. Make sure to get their LinkedIn or contact information before you leave! One of them may end up with a great internship or job in the future and can put you in contact with the right people.5. Dress to ImpressAlways check with your supervisor about dress code before your first day. In my experience, the employees dressed more casually than I was led to believe. But there is a difference between casual and sloppy. It’s always better to be overdressed.5. Pay AttentionThere’s so much that goes on in New York City. Keep your eyes open or you might miss something exciting! ; )Do you have a way with words? Apply to write for Her Campus!When in doubt, just put your phone away and let calls go to voicemail.

No matter what your financial situation, it is important to follow some basic principle rules when it comes to spending in college.
 
Here at Her Campus Emory, we’ve come to have a good grasp of what’s worth the money, what might not be, and what you should take in moderation.
 SPLURGE-WORTHYA Winter Coat. A good coat is always an extremely good investment (especially after this winter in Atlanta), and we fully support splurging on three different types: a sporty one (think Northface or a puffer), a dress coat (a black or gray pea coat or double-breasted dress coat), and a trench coat (or some other kind of rain-proof piece).  A good coat will not only be versatile and warm, but will also last several years if you stick to a more basic (less trendy) style.
 A Pair of Rainboots.  Take it from someone who once bought a pair of neon-green J.Crew rainboots for fourteen dollars and then had soaking feet two weeks later—splurge on some rain-resistant footwear! Brands like Hunter, Sperry, and Kamik are great choices.
 A Good Handbag. Every girl should have one nice handbag—a medium-sized, any-shape, neutral-colored bag that works in a plethora of ways.  Upscale designers like Kate Spade and Marc Jacobs create extremely high-quality bags that are not only timeless, but durable. As much as we love our trendy cross-bodies for nights at Maggie’s and Famous, brown or black leather options from upper-middle designers are certainly worth the investment.  Just try to keep the caps on your pens and stay several feel away from any spilled liquids!
 A Mattress Pad.  At Emory, we spend a minimum of two years atop the rock hard ResLife mattresses. In the crazy lifestyles we lead in college, getting a good night’s sleep is extremely important, and a strong mattress pad can make all the difference. Your health and well-being are definitely worth the extra cash!
 A GPS.  It can be hard to navigate a new city, especially with Atlanta’s many one-ways and round-abouts. These mini-computers are amazing devices that will get you from point A to point B without the hassle of refreshing your smart phone or printing out sketchy directions from Google Maps and MapQuest. Invest in a decent case and it’ll last for a long time.
 
No matter what you choose to splurge on, the most important rule is that you think long and hard before making your final decision. Anything can be worth the money if it is something you’ll really appreciate and get good use out of! Happy spending!

 Do you have a way with words? Apply to write for Her Campus!I’m happy to finally announce my Shopify store, MY Hankies, has finally launched! It’s taken me months of preparation, finalizing production details, and forming partnerships to finally reach this point. As I mentioned in my first post about launching MY Hankies— I’m not a computer programmer. So when I had this idea to create my own online store that would sell crafts, handmade by the Mexican Mayan women, the whole building my own website thing felt like it was going to be a huge hurdle to overcome. Fortunately, Shopify seriously prevented many future headaches I could have had during this process.

My store sells handmade hankies, jewelry, clutches (and more) from the Mexican Mayan community to help alleviate poverty and raise awareness about child labor. During my January visit to the village of Chichen Itza, Mexico, where the Mayan calendar is located, I was moved by the large number of children begging my mom and I to purchase a handmade handkerchief. After that trip I wanted to find a way to sell those handkerchiefs and other crafts to help them.
My first post discussed how I was creating and finalizing the design of my store. However, it wasn’t too long after that I went back and completely redesigned the site for the fourth or fifth time. The best part though is that I never had to actually change the theme or do tons of work to make it look completely different than it did just days before. It was only a matter of changing colors and uploading my own photos — an easy task using Shopify.
Look at the final design of the front page here:

After finalizing the design, I felt like I was stuck in limbo as I waited for the Mayan women to finish sewing the handkerchiefs, purses, and jewelry, and send them to me. Since this was going to be a time when either a lot or zero activity would be occurring on the site, I didn’t want people viewing it during its stages of construction. Shopify solved that problem by providing me with the option to set a password lock on the site.
Another issue I had to sort out before the MY Hankies launch was how my website ranked in search engines (SEO). At first, when I would enter “MY Hankies” in Google, my website would not appear until a few or even a dozen pages down the line. This was puzzling to me and would not be good for my store or potential customers. But, another great part of Shopify, is that exploring your website’s interface really isn’t intimidating at all. After recognizing this problem, I ventured into the “marketing” tab and learned that Shopify creates a “sitemap” for your website. Now, if you asked me what a site map was two weeks ago, I’d probably tell you it’s a map on a website (Uh, like, Mapquest?). I’m just kidding—sort of.
Shopify taught me that when referring to your website’s sitemap, you are referring to a code that is used as a marketing tool to increase your search engine optimization (page rankings). Now that I had this sitemap, I wasn’t quite sure exactly what I was supposed to do with it. Thankfully, those directions were readily available to me, and then waa-laa, my website showed up on the second page of Google after searching “MY Hankies.” Thank you sitemap!
When my products arrived, I was finally able to upload them to the site which was easy to organize and fun to do. With Shopify you are able to organize your products by color, weight, size, and more. Since my products were a little more complicated to categorize (the designs of the handkerchiefs are all completely different), I didn’t utilize this as much as I would have liked to, but it will definitely be helpful for future products. Shopify also allows you to set a lock that will prevent customers from making purchases when a product is sold-out.
Now that my store is ready for sales, I’m excited to start managing my orders and customers using Shopify. Make sure to check out MY Hankies and purchase a hankie, or my favorite, a primitive clutch (they are seriously so adorable and well-made). And follow me next week as I blog more about using Shopify to create my own online store!
