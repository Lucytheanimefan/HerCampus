For this week's profile we decided to shine the spotlight on Amazon's new pickup location at the ASUC Student Union Center.                                                                   http://mms.businesswire.com/media/20160114005323/en/504442/5/amazon-asuc...Everyone has been buzzing about this new service that Amazon has installed on our campus to make our lives as students much easier. You can know order anything online and the very next day it will be waiting for you in a special locker. Only you can open that special locker with a specific code that is emailed to you once your item is ready. If you are an Amazon Student or Prime member you are eligible for free same-day pickup. Amazon has also installed a little lounge area to sit back and relax. We recommend you take some time from your busy day to check out this awesome new location on campus that will most definitely be a hotspot this semester.  Hooray for Amazon!! More Info: http://asucstudentunion.amazon.com/gp/campus?ie=UTF8&ref=cmps_splsh_alrdy_subd                                                                   http://www.berkeleyside.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/IMG_0071-720x540.jpg                                                                                     https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CYtLVxDUQAAUuu0.jpgHi my name is Monica Morales and I am a sophomore at UC Berkeley.

Even though "it’s the thought that counts," 9 times out of 10 we end up with another ugly pink sweater. We thank you so much for the kindness and love that went into that sweater that meows jingle bells, but I think this year we should move forward. Here’s a cheat sheet for the fun and useful things we all really need, but probably wouldn’t buy ourselves!…because no one enjoys a warm beer....because let's face it, those 17 alarms we have set just don't cut it.…because anything that will make life easier is welcomed. Seriously, where have these been all of our lives?!...because sometimes it's just one of those days....because we just don't need that negativity in our lives....beause pizza is life and life is pizza....because sometimes we just need to drift away with the stars....because we don't need the stress of losing our cookie to the dark depths of the unknown....because we're tired of choosing between putting our hands through the pain of carrying all the bags and risk crushing the eggs or making 38 trips back and forth from the car to the kitchen....because we all have a child within us.

Now as college students, we tend to turn on Netflix or scroll through endless social media posts on our smartphones whenever we get a free hour or so. In free moments when we should be turning our brains off, we automatically switch on our electronics. Electronics do not necessarily help in unwinding or relaxing. Why not try an unplugged activity that stimulates creativity? Why not color?Haven’t you heard? Coloring is no longer just for kids!Coloring books for adults have soared in popularity in the United States and around the world. Many have shared their experiences and enjoyment of books with gorgeously intricate designs. British illustrator Johanna Basford’s books have become international best sellers on Amazon. If you are interested in new ways to relieve stress, you can find links to purchase two different works below:http://www.amazon.com/Enchanted-Forest-Inky-Quest-Coloring/dp/1780674880/ref=zg_bs_books_13http://www.amazon.com/Secret-Garden-Inky-Treasure-Coloring/dp/1780671067/ref=zg_bs_books_8Not only does coloring allow you to access your creativity, it has also been shown to reduce the effects of anxiety and combat stress. Your breathing rate and heart rate will settle as you lose yourself in the process. The last time that you sat and colored in a picture, you probably didn’t have term papers or midterms to worry about. Revisit the child in you. From simple patterns to detailed imaginary gardens and cities, there are so many books and illustrations to choose from. Slow down from the buzzing and sometimes hectic everyday life of a UC Davis, quarter system student. Happy coloring!Kirsten is currently a second year student at UC Davis and is double majoring in Communications and English.

They also introduced paid paternity leave for parents other than the birth mother for six weeks. Prior to Amazon's announcement, no paid leave option was available to the non-birth parent.Amazon employees will also have the option to give all or part of their six weeks of leave to their partner if they do not get parental leave through their work.Paid paternity leave affects same-sex couples as well, which is a nice step forward considering in the U.S. people can still legally be fired for being gay in 31 states, according to the Human Rights Campaign. The U.S. Census notes that 40 percent of new mothers have to take unpaid leave, and that 25 percent of those mothers are fired or quit their jobs upon returning from leave.After new parents are ready to return to work, Amazon hopes to ease their transition with their new "ramp back program," allowing them flexible schedules for the first eight weeks after their return. A study mentioned in Fast Company noted that the U.S. was one of only two countries out of the 185 studied that did not have public policy on maternity leave. Around 42 percent of those countries, still excluding the U.S., also have public policy regarding paternity leave.During last month's Democratic debate, both Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders spoke in favor of laws mandating that companies offer paid family leave. New Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, on the other hand, recently said he does not support paid family leave.Hopefully, Amazon and other companies will continue to work on improving working conditions and offering benefits that just make sense. Only time can tell if that will happen, but for now it seems safe to say that Amazon's taking a step in the right direction.  Kayla is a freshman at the University of California, Santa Cruz, where she's studying literature and history.
