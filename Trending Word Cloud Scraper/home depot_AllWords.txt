Apply to write for Her Campus!Underwater Dreams, written and directed by Mary Mazzio, and narrated by Michael Peña, is an epic story of how the sons of undocumented Mexican immigrants learned how to build an underwater robot from Home Depot parts. And defeat engineering powerhouse MIT in the process.  Two energetic high school science teachers, on a whim, decided to enter their high school, a Title I school where most of the students live in poverty, into a sophisticated underwater robotics competition sponsored by the NASA and the Office of Naval Research, among others. Only four boys signed up for the competition, but once assembled, with enthusiasm and verve, they started calling oceanic engineers and military contractors for design help. They were advised that their underwater robot would require glass syntactic flotation foam. Short on money, all they could afford was PVC pipe from Home Depot.  And some duct tape.  This rag-tag high school team of undocumented Mexican boys did what no one thought possible. The competition, however, was only the beginning. These boys forged a legacy that could not have been imagined. Hi! I am Ayanna and I am the Editor-in-Chief of Her Campus Georgia Southern.

Between buying school supplies, registering for classes and setting up a new apartment, it’s easy to get stressed, but relax! Her Campus has you covered with some back-to-school hacks that will ensure you’re ready for the year ahead. Whether you’re a senior or about to start your freshman year of college, here are seven fool-proof ways to make sure you kick off the semester the right way! 1. Create your own planner If you take only one thing away from this list, make it this one. Getting a planner is the best thing you can do to keep yourself on track. Get in the habit of writing down everything — from orientation events to exams to parties. While some pre-designed planners can be pricey, rest assured that it’s possible to create a super-stylish planner and save some money! We love this unique binder from Office Depot!By adding the black and gold inserts, you can totally customize it into a planner — keeping your notes and to-do lists all in one place, but organized and divided exactly how you like it. Talk about budget-savvy!  2. Set up an organization systemIf you’re a senior, this is old news; freshmen, take note: There is nothing worse than desperately looking for a notebook (that contains today’s homework!) in a mountain of school supplies with only five minutes ‘til class time. Here’s a better way: color code! Choose a color for each of your classes and then coordinate: red folders and red notebooks for chemistry, for example. Then, instead of rummaging through a pile of notebooks, grab everything red in sight and head to lab! Office Depot’s newest collection of back-to-school must haves makes it easy with its huge assortment of folders, binders and notebooks in lots of fun, bright colors. 3. Buy a coffee makerWe know, we know: It’s simply more fun going to the campus coffee shop for your morning latte. The money adds up fast, though — especially for something you could be home-brewing for a fraction of the cost. Consider buying a coffee maker for your dorm room or apartment (plus a stylish to-go cup for your morning java). You’ll save a ton of money over the year! The same goes for your tea addiction, collegiettes!4. Pack lunchIt’s no secret that eating on the go isn’t exactly the most cost-effective option. While it’s tempting to splurge for a salad at the cafe between classes, packing lunch will save you a ton of money in the long run, especially if you live off-campus with no meal plan. And yes — we know what you’re thinking; no one wants to walk around campus with a geeky brown paper lunch bag! May we suggest a cooler alternative like this lunch cube from Office Depot? Spill proof? Check. Keep your food from getting squished? Check. Show off your personality? Check! 5. Rent your textbooks Renting your textbooks instead of buying them is a great way to save money — and trust us, you’re not going to want that heavy calculus book sitting around next year anyway. Most campus bookstores have renting options, and many (though, double-check first) even allow you to use a highlighter right on the book’s pages. Make studying easier with a Sharpie Clear View® highlighter; the clear tip will make sure you know exactly what you’re highlighting (and exactly what to cram before the test!) 6. Set up a great desk  Yes, it’s the beginning of the school year, but the campus library can fill up fast. In case you prefer a quieter (and cuter) study space, having a perfectly organized desk at home ensures that you’ll get the work done. Organize your color-coded notebooks, folders and binders, and then insert some personality with fun supplies like Office Depot’s Post-it® golden apple sticky note dispenser. We promise that setting up a well-curated (and food-themed) study space in advance of hectic deadlines will make your school year go by smoothly!7. Take advantage of the campus gym  Sick of your usual running route and looking for something new to do? Your on-campus recreation center probably has a ton of great (free) activities and classes for students. Yoga, cardio kickboxing, swim lessons, you name it — the rec center’s got it, and trust us, you’re going to want to get out of the library every once in a while! Whether you’re an athlete or just into casual exercise, make the gym more fun by bringing a friend or two along. And don’t forget to write it in your planner! While college itself is no breeze, by taking these easy and fun steps, you’ll rock your school year!
