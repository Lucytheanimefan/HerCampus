For nearly two years, the city has been in a water crisis.For years, Flint had been using Detroit’s water system, which meant paying a fee. As a city facing economic problems, the city changed its water source from Lake Huron to Flint River, which would cut out that cost from city budget.City officials were working on a new water system that would supply water from Lake Huron but at a lower price. Flint would need another water source for the duration of the project, expected to be two years. The solution to this was to use Flint River, known to locals for its filth.Shortly after the switch, residents noticed their water smelled, tasted, and looked strange. Yahoo! News reported “residents developed rashes, hair loss and other health ailments.” As if this wasn’t enough, contaminants like E. Coli were found in the water. Despite this, officials continued to assure residents that the water was safe to drink.It was not until this past October that officials acknowledged the problem and took action. Flint went back to using water from Detroit and the National Guard came to help distribute water and other aid supplies. However, the damage had already been done. Flint River water contained lead, which has irreversible health impacts. A local doctor, Dr. Mona Hanna-Attisha, tested toddler’s blood to find that there were extremely high levels of lead. Some long-term consequences include “learning disabilities, behavioral problems and mental retardation,” according to the World Health Organization.But who is to blame in this crisis? Many say that Michigan Governor Rick Snyder holds responsibility, and has recently come under intense pressure to make changes. Others believe that the Department of Environmental Quality should be held responsible, and four families have filed lawsuits against it. Regardless of who shoulders the blame, the carelessness of city and state officials has changed the lives of many, and not positively. The coming weeks will tell what is next for Flint, Michigan.              Caroline is a sophomore at Fairfield University.

But MIT just took a big step toward making certain degree programs more affordable and accessible.Yahoo! Finance reports that the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which has offered free online courses to students for the past four years, will now allow for those courses to be counted toward a degree. The STEM oriented school will let students take a semester of free courses in one of MIT’s 24 graduate programs, including microbiology, real estate development and oceanography. After paying a fee of $1,500 and passing an exam, students can then receive a MicroMaster’s credential, which counts as half of the college’s one-year master’s degree program in supply chain management.Students who succeed in the first online half of the program can take another exam to apply for the second semester on campus. For that semester, they'll have to pay $33,000 (about half the cost of program’s yearlong tuition).“Anyone who wants to be here now has a shot to be here,” MIT President L. Rafael Reif told Yahoo!. “They have a chance to prove in advance that they can do the work.”The courses are scheduled to begin this winter, and the program hopes to bring about 40 students to campus each semester from the online program.MIT is not the first university to begin the transfer of free online programs to school certified credential. Arizona State University, the Georgia Institute of Technology, and the University of Illinois all have similar programs.Hopefully, these programs will help in maintaining the balance between finances and academics, because as any collegiette knows, trying to find the money to for takeout during those all-nighters is struggle enough.Keana is a sophomore at Bryn Mawr College in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania and News Blogger/Viral Content Writer for Her Campus.

The two teams played in Wembley Stadium in London as part of the NFL International Series. Earlier this year the Miami Dolphins took on the New York Jets in London on October 4. The Detroit Lions will take on the Kansas City Chiefs in London on November 1.In addition to the football game, fans in London were able to attend an NFL Fan Rally in Trafalgar Square before the Jets-Giants game, complete with the players, cheerleaders, and NFL legends.Before the Bills-Jags game, fans were able to visit a decked out Regent Street, which was closed for the events. There were games, historical displays, musical performance, cheerleaders, players, and coaches.The Bills and the Jaguars were chosen to be part of the NFL’s streaming experiment because both teams have struggled in recent years.The Bills have missed the playoffs for 15 consecutive seasons, the NFL’s longest active playoff drought. They also lost four consecutive Super Bowls in the early nineties (I was born the day after the third consecutive loss, it’s tough to be a Bills fan).The Jaguars have had losing records six out of the last seven years and have been the worst in the league, with only 10 wins and 44 losses, over the last four seasons. Fans in Buffalo and Jacksonville were able to watch the games locally on television, but most fans watched the game live on Yahoo!.The live stream had an average viewership of 2.36 million people per minute. Since the game was on live locally, the streaming numbers don’t tell the full story. About 15.2 million viewers were exposed to the live stream, which started playing automatically on Yahoo!. Approximately 33% of viewership came from countries outside of the United States. Viewership would likely have been greater in the game had kicked later. It started at 2:30PM in London, which is 9:30AM EST. The Jaguars beat the Bills 34-31.The Lions will take on the Chiefs at 9:30AM this Sunday on FOXFollow HCND on Twitter, like us on Facebook, Pin with us and show our Instagram some love!Images: 1, 2, 3, 4 Lindsey Visser, 5, 6Sources: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 Maria is finishing her Masters in English at Notre Dame. She has read many good books and several bad books, but she usually tries not to finish those. Her current favorites are: 1984, The Book Thief, The Tragedy Paper, Code Name Verity, Dr. Copernicus, I Am the Messenger, Alice in Wonderland, Peter Pan, and of course, Harry Potter. She is writing her second thesis on Harry Potter, exploring notions of authorship and reader agency in the digital age. She even managed to write her Capstone on British Children's Literature and designed her own Directed Readings Course on Notre Dame history during undergrad. Her favorite way to read is with a mug of tea and scented candles. When she doesn't have her nose stuck in a book, she can be found binging on the BBC (Downton Abbey, Doctor Who, Sherlock, Merlin [RIP]). Her favorite color is purple, she studied abroad in London, and she enjoys being an amateur painter. She harbors a not-so-secret dream of one day writing a children's book, but until then, she is likely to be found reading them and writing letters whenever she gets a chance. She hopes to teach English or work in a university sharing her love of education.Do you have a way with words?

News. The accident killed four people at the parade and injured many more.Chambers' attorney, Tony Coleman, said at a press conference that he ruled alcohol out as a factor in the crash, but said that his client possibly suffers from mental illness which could have contributed to the accident. Police are still waiting for test results to determine if alcohol or drugs were in Chambers' system."She doesn't remember a whole lot about what happened," Coleman said. "There was a period where I think ... she could have even blacked out."Oklahoma State University students and faculty in the meantime are banding together during the difficult times.
